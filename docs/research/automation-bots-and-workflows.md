# Automation Bots and Workflow Boundaries

> Reviewed: 2026-09-08

> Evidence type: repository configuration plus official GitHub documentation

This note records what automation can do in this repository and what remains a
human decision. It is maintainer guidance, not runtime skill content.

## Repository actors

| Actor | Current use here | Effective boundary |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `dependabot[bot]` | Proposes UV and GitHub Actions dependency updates | Creates branches and pull requests; does not merge them |
| `github-actions[bot]` | Runs `validate` and GitHub-managed Dependabot update workflows | Current repository workflow token is read-only; no PR, branch, release, or issue mutation |
| Human maintainer | Reviews dependency changes and policy exceptions | Merges changes and changes repository settings |

The `github-actions[bot]` identity is the execution identity for workflow jobs,
not evidence that a workflow has broad write authority. Effective permissions
come from the workflow `permissions` block and any job-level override.

## Current configuration

Dependabot checks both ecosystems weekly:

- GitHub Actions updates are grouped under `actions-maintenance`;
- UV development updates are grouped under `uv-maintenance`;
- only minor and patch updates are grouped;
- major updates remain separate for manual review;
- each ecosystem is capped at two open pull requests;
- labels identify dependency, Python/UV, and GitHub Actions changes.

The repository's `validate` workflow has two lanes:

1. `deterministic` runs on pushes and pull requests. It uses read-only
   permissions, pinned actions, a pinned UV version, the locked environment,
   custom repository validation, `skills-ref`, fixture tests, lint, and format
   checks.
2. `monitor-external-contracts` runs only on the weekly schedule or manual
   dispatch. It checks external evidence URLs and freshness markers. Its URL
   checker retries bounded transient failures but still fails persistent drift.

Merged source branches are deleted by the repository setting. No repository
workflow creates, approves, merges, rebases, closes, or deletes pull requests.
Native Dependabot auto-merge is disabled.

## Important GitHub behavior

- A workflow's `GITHUB_TOKEN` is short-lived and scoped to the job. Unspecified
  permissions are not granted when the workflow sets a restrictive permission
  block.
- Events caused by `GITHUB_TOKEN` generally do not recursively trigger new
  workflow runs. `workflow_dispatch` and `repository_dispatch` are explicit
  exceptions.
- Dependabot pull-request workflows should be treated as untrusted dependency
  changes. They must not receive ordinary repository secrets by default.
- Grouping reduces review and CI volume; it does not establish that an update
  is safe. Review the diff and green checks before merging.
- A successful workflow proves only the checks it actually ran. A skipped
  external-monitor job on a pull request is expected because that lane is
  schedule/manual-only.

## Maintainer routine

1. Review Dependabot pull requests weekly.
2. Merge narrow, green dependency-only updates after inspecting the diff.
3. Close superseded or stale proposals when a newer grouped update replaces
   them.
4. Confirm merged branches are removed automatically.
5. Investigate failed or ambiguous checks; do not bypass protection merely to
   clear a queue.
6. Re-check this note when adding a workflow that writes issues, releases,
   attestations, pull requests, branches, or repository settings.
